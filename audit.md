## HTTP & HTTPS

**HyperText Transfer Protocol** (HTTP), is a protocol that allows communication between browsers and servers. It is the foundation of how data is transferred on the web. However, HTTP alone is unencrypted, which poses as a security risk for users since personal information is at a risk of being stolen. In order to prevent this, websites should always use **HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure** (HTTPS), so that connections between the browser and server are automatically encrypted, and would subsequently allow users to safely exchange sensitive data with a server.

## Lang attributes

The `lang` attribute is used to determine the main language of a website. It can help search engines understand the language and serve it to users in search results, and it allows screen readers to properly pronounce text.

## Images

Images on a website should try to be served using next-gen formats such as [WebP](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp) since it on average can be 25-35% smaller than JPEG images, 26% smaller than PNG images and still provide great quality.

In addition to trying to serve smaller sized images, they should also be **lazy loaded**. Lazy loading is a technique where you download resources only as their needed. This can significantly improve the performance of a website since the browser no longer needs to download every image at once. You would typically lazy load images that aren't immediately on the viewport, since users won't be able to see them once the page first loads.

## Responsive web design

Responsive design is a technique used to created layouts that can _respond_ to any screen width and display content properly. Without it, users might have a hard time navigating through a website since they would have to manually zoom in to the bits of the website they might find interesting. One way to ensure a website can be responsive on mobile devices, is by including a [viewport](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Viewport_meta_tag) meta tag, which tells browsers to make the width of the content on a page, the same width as the users' device.

Here is an example of how a website would look without the viewport meta tag on an iPhone SE:

And here is that same example with the inclusion of the viewport meta tag:

Although there's still some work to do for the website to be fully responsive, it is still a step forward towards providing a good experience for users on mobile.

## Focus management

Although it's common for most users on a desktop to navigate a website with a mouse, there are certain cases where someone might only have a keyboard. In a situation like this, users will use <kbd>Tab</kbd> and <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd> to move forward on backwards on a website from one focusable element to the next. By default, when an element is focused it will be outlined in black. This is to help users visually identify where they are currently on the website.

Here is an example of a search bar when it's not focused:

And here the browser is natively indicating that the search bar is being focused:

For the icons below, the browser is not able to indicate that one of the icons are being focused. When this happens, it is up to the developer to manually apply styles to elements that are focusable.

## Other

- Images do not have an `alt` attribute. This is used to show alternative text in the event where an image fails to download. It is also useful to provide context on an image for users who are visually impaired.
  Ex:
  In the images below, the source to one of the images was manually removed. This is to help illustrate what happens when an image that's failed to load does not contain alternative text.

  **Image with no alternative text:**

- Links do not have a discernible name. When links do not contain any text (like when a link wraps an icon), developers must manually tell the browser what the link might be used for. Otherwise, screen readers won't be able to annouce links to users.
  Ex:
  In the image below, most people will be able to visually tell what these icons are for, however, a screen reader will not.

## Changes

- Add Favicon
- Search bar, displays search results in a very disorganized manner
- Emphasis on search bar, with Auto-completion to search keywords
- Classify serach results by type (if articles classified under 'one' articles tab)

### Navbar

- Each element on the navbar is actually a link that redirects to #
- Each element is actually a dropdown (make this more obvious)

### Page 'Le président'

- The Presidents speech is in 2 different languages and should have a button to switch between them.

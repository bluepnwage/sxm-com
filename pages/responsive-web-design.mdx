Responsive design is a technique used to created layouts that can _respond_ to any screen width and
display content properly. Without it, users might have a hard time navigating through a website since
they would have to manually zoom in to the bits of the website they might find interesting. One way to
ensure a website can be responsive on mobile devices, is by including a
[viewport](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Viewport_meta_tag) meta tag, which
tells browsers to make the width of the content on a page, the same width as the users' device.

In the example below, you can see how the website is rendered with and without the viewport meta tag on an iPhone SE.

<Tabs items={["Missing viewport meta tag", "Included viewport meta tag"]}>
  <Tab>![image](/mobile-no-viewport.jpg)</Tab>
  <Tab>![image](/mobile-viewport.png)</Tab>
</Tabs>
<Callout type="info">
  On top of including the viewport meta tag, some of the elements have been manually updated to render the
  webpage properly on mobile. Although there's still some work to do for the website to be fully responsive,
  it is still a step forward towards providing a good experience for users on mobile.

## Autocomplete

Whenever users encounter a content-heavy website, they might rely on the websites searchbar to find content
rather than manually searching through every page. But sometimes, simply having a searchbar is not enough.
A user might have a general idea on what to search, but it might not be specific
enough for the server to return the content they're looking for. Once the user enters their search, they will
have to wait for:

- The server to filter out the results
- The browser to wait for a response from the server and reload
- The browser to redownload all the necessary assets and then showing the search results

In the worst case, the user could have patiently waited for this, just for the browser to show them undesired
results, or no results altogether.

A great way to improve how your website handles searches is by having autocomplete for full-text-search.
You can show search results for what the user is looking for as they're typing it. You can now let
your users know ahead of time if they should complete their search or refactor their keywords so they
can narrow down the results.

Below is an example of autocomplete by [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/).

## Structure

Some of the links on the website could be grouped up in order to avoid repetition. For example,
in the image below, 4 out of the 7 links point to the homepage of the [Tourist Office](https://www.st-martin.org).

The same issue is repeated for other external links such as:

- [Tax office website](https://www.impots-saint-martin.fr)
- [Reserve naturelle](https://www.reservenaturelle-saint-martin.com/)

<Callout>
  A solution to this could be to move all external links to a single section called "External resources".

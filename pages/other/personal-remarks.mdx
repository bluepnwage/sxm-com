## Autocomplete

Whenever users encounter a content-heavy website, they might rely on the websites searchbar to find content
rather than manually searching through every page. But sometimes, simply having a searchbar is not enough.
A user might have a general idea on what to search, but it might not be specific
enough for the server to return the content they're looking for. Once the user enters their search, they will
have to wait for:

- The server to filter out the results
- The browser to wait for a response from the server and reload
- The browser to redownload all the necessary assets and then showing the search results

In the worst case, the user could have patiently waited for this, just for the browser to show them undesired
results, or no results altogether.

A great way to improve how your website handles searches is by having autocomplete for full-text-search.
You can show search results for what the user is looking for as they're typing it. You can now let
your users know ahead of time if they should complete their search or refactor their keywords so they
can narrow down the results.

Below is an example of autocomplete by [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/).

## Structure

Some of the links on the website could be grouped up in order to avoid repetition. For example,
in the image below, 4 out of the 7 links point to the homepage of the [Tourist Office](https://www.st-martin.org).

The same issue is repeated for other external links such as:

- [Tax office website](https://www.impots-saint-martin.fr)
- [Reserve naturelle](https://www.reservenaturelle-saint-martin.com/)

<Callout>
  A solution to this could be to move all external links to a single section called "External resources".

## Translations

Translations can be tedious to implement on a website but when done correctly, can vastly improve your target
audience. One problem with the Collectivités website is the lack of visual cues that there's translated content.

Take the [inaugration speech](http://www.com-saint-martin.fr/La-presidence_Saint-Martin-Services_2511.html)
for the president for example. Upon landing on this page, it is not evident that there's an english version of
the speech after the french one. A simple fix for this, would be to include a toggle that allows users
to easily switch between the different languages. The inclusion of the toggle serves two purposes:

- Indicate that the speech can be viewed in both french and english
- Allow users to easily switch from one language to the next.

Another issue with the website is the minimal amount of translated content, which may seem
acceptable since its located on the French side of the island. However, if you take a look at the official
website for the [U.S government](https://www.usa.gov/) there's the option to view it in spanish. Although Spanish
is spoken by only **13 percent** of the entire US population, they still recognized the importance of
translating the entire website. It's unclear how much english is spoken compared to french in Saint Martin,
nevertheless, it _might_ be safe to say that it's split evenly. Despite this, there isn't an option to view
the website for the Collectivité in different languages.

  Note: An argument could be made that it's not important to translate the website in english. My only opinion
  is that a choice should be made to either translate the **entire website** or keep it all in one language.

## Images

Images on a website should try to be served using next-gen formats such as
[WebP](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp) since it on average can be 25-35% smaller than JPEG images,
26% smaller than PNG images and still provide great quality.

In addition to trying to serve smaller sized images, they should also be **lazy loaded**. Lazy loading is a
technique where you download resources only as their needed.
This can significantly improve the performance of a website since the browser
no longer needs to download every image at once. You would typically lazy load images that aren't
immediately visible, since users won't be able to see them once the page first loads.

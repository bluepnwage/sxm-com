## Images

Images on a website should try to be served using next-gen formats such as
[WebP](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp) since it on average can be 25-35% smaller than JPEG images,
26% smaller than PNG images and still provide great quality.

In addition to trying to serve smaller sized images, they should also be **lazy loaded**. Lazy loading is a
technique where you download resources only as their needed.
This can significantly improve the performance of a website since the browser
no longer needs to download every image at once. You would typically lazy load images that aren't
immediately visible, since users won't be able to see them once the page first loads.

As you can see in the image below, 30 images are being downloaded by the browser on initial page load. This
results in 24MB of images being sent over the network, when the user only sees 3 images when they land on
the website for the Collectivit√©.

## JavaScript

JavaScript is a scripting language mainly used for websites to make them interactive. The more JavaScript
you write, the more you can make a website feel like a desktop or mobile application. This does come with a cost,
JavaScript in most cases is the leading contributor to slowing down a website since the browser neeeds to:

- Download your script files
- Evaluate them to check for errors
- Execute the code

Depending on the size of your JavasScript files, this process could end up blocking the main thread of your browser
and temporarily freeze the website.

There are 4 main ways to avoid this issue:

- Writing efficient code
- Decreasing the size of your main bundle
- Implement code splitting to only download necessary code
- Offloading the download of certain scripts to [web workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers)

## HTTP & HTTPS

**HyperText Transfer Protocol** (HTTP), is a protocol that allows communication between browsers and servers.
It is the foundation of how data is transferred on the web. However, HTTP alone is unencrypted,
which poses as a security risk for users since personal information is at a risk of being stolen.
In order to prevent this, websites should always use **HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure** (HTTPS),
so that connections between the browser and server are automatically encrypted, and would subsequently
allow users to safely exchange sensitive data with a server.

Here is a simplified diagram which represents the communication between client and server:

Here is a screenshot of Google Chrome showing a warning that the website is not secure.

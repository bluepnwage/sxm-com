When developing a website, they are official guidelines called _Web Content Accessiblity Guidelines_ (WCAG) which set standards
on how websites should be built. These guidelines are maintained by The
[_World Wide Web Consortium_](https://www.w3.org/) (W3C) to help improve accessiblity for users with disabilities
or low-end devices.

## Image alt tags

An `alt` attribute on an image is used to show alternative text in the event where the browser fails
to download an image.
It is also useful to provide context on an image for users who are visually impaired. Without this attribute, screen
readers will try to read the name of the file as alternative text which isn't helpful.

In the example below, the source to one of the images was manually removed. This is to help illustrate what happens when an image that's failed to load does not contain alternative text.

<Tabs items={['Missing alt text', 'Included alt text']}>
    <Tab>
    ![image](/missing-alt.png)
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
    ![image](/included-alt.png)
    </Tab>

</Tabs>

<Callout type="info">
  In certain cases it's okay to omit alternative text, however, the `alt` attribute should *always* be
  included. This can be achieved by including an empty `alt` attribute (`alt=""`). Doing this will inform
  screen readers to ignore an image rather than trying to read the name of the image file.
</Callout>

Another issue to avoid is using images with lots of text to relay important information. If there are no
alternatives and _you must include text in your images_, then you should repeat the text in the `alt` attribute
for screen readers.

## Focus management

Although it's common for most users on a desktop to navigate a website with a mouse,
there are certain cases where someone might only have a keyboard. In a situation like this,
users will use <Hotkey>Tab</Hotkey> and <Hotkey>Shift</Hotkey> + <Hotkey>Tab</Hotkey> to move forward
on backwards on a website from one focusable element to the next.

Some examples of focusable elements are:

- Buttons
- Links
- Form inputs

By default when an element is focused, the browser will outline it in black. This is to help users
visually identify where they are currently on the website.

<Tabs items={["Unfocused search bar", "Focused search bar"]}>
  <Tab>![image](/non-focused-input.png)</Tab>
  <Tab>![image](/focused-input.png)</Tab>
</Tabs>

For the icons below, the browser is not able to indicate that one of the icons are being focused.
When this happens, it is up to the developer to manually apply styles to elements that are focusable.

## Buttons

Whenever you want to perform an action in response to a user clicking on an element, it's handled using a button.
Sometimes developers try to implement their own button rather than using the built-in button element in HTML so it can
be easier to style it however they see fit. This is troublesome however, since now you lose the necessary
properties an element needs to be marked as a button.

Here are a few things you will miss out on when implementing your own button:

- The button can no longer be focused and therefore will be skipped when navigating with a keyboard
- There won't be a label associated with the custom button so screen readers won't be able to read out what
  purpose the button serves
- It won't have a button role which results in screen readers not knowing that the element is supposed to be a
  button

In the first example below, the button for the search bar has all the necessary properties to
be considered a button. In the carousel, the previous and next icons aren't semantically buttons an therefore won't
function and be interpreted like a native button.

<Tabs items={["Built-in button", "Simulated button"]}>
  <Tab>![example of using the built-in button element for websites](/organic-button.png)</Tab>
  <Tab>
    ![](/simulated-button.png) <br /> ![](/simulated-button2.png)
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Links

When links do not contain any text (when a link wraps an icon for example), developers must manually
provide labels for those links . Otherwise, screen readers won't be able to annouce links to users.

As an example, in the image below, most users will be able to visually tell what these icons represent and what purpose they serve.
However, a screen reader will not read these links and thus will skip them.

## Color contrast

When working with colors, it is important to measure the contrast between background and foreground content
to ensure legibility. In most cases, good color contrast can be established by having a dark background and
light foreground (or light background and dark foreground). Doing this is not only helpful for all of your users,
but can also help users with color blindness, since they will perceive colors differently.

In the navigation bar, the text color is `#F1F1F1` and the background in `#28A6D2`.

There isn't sufficient contrast between the two colors and as a consequence, the website is failing the WCAG
guidelines for contrast ratio.

## Lang attribute

The `lang` attribute is used to determine the main language of a website. It can help search engines
understand the language and serve it to users in search results, and it allows screen readers
to properly pronounce text.
